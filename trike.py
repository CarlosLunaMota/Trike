"""
    Trike is a two-player, combinatorial, abstract strategy game designed
    by Alek Erickson in April 2020.


    Play on an equilateral triangular hexagon-tessellated grid with sides
    between 6-12. Use a neutral pawn and black/white checkers.

    Players take turns moving a neutral pawn around on the board (passing
    is not allowed). The neutral pawn can move any number of empty points,
    in any direction in a straight line, but cannot move onto, or jump over
    occupied points.

    When a player moves the pawn, first they place a checker of their own
    color onto the destination point, then they move the pawn on top of it.
    When the pawn is trapped, the game is over.

    At the end of the game, each player gets a point for each checker
    of their own color adjacent to, or underneath, the pawn. The person
    with the highest score wins.
